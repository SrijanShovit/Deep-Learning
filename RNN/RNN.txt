For NLP,sequqnce is important but ANN doesn't support sequqncing in very effective way

With simple ANN language processing gets difficult as no of input and output 
neurons is fixed but our sentence size is not fixed and taking one word as one neuron
we never know the noof neurons to use in simple ANN

Neural networks work on numbers not words so words have to be hot encoded into numbers
but that brings lots of heavy computation.This has to be done both for input and output

Different sentences in one sentence might have same translated sentence in other
language.But ANN doesn't allow shared parameters and model has to learn again same meaning 
but different looking sentence
